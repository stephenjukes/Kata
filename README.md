## Elemental Words

This solution has been created in such a way that the code in the [ElementalWords.cs](https://github.com/stephenjukes/Kata/blob/main/ElementalWords/ElementalWords.cs) file can be copied and pasted directly into the [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56fa9cd6da8ca623f9001233/train/csharp).

The top 1,000 English words have been used to demsonstrate the output of the `ElementalForms` method by logging to the console, (though only a little over a quarter can be formed using element symbols).

[XUnit tests](https://github.com/stephenjukes/Kata/blob/main/Tests/ElementalWordsTests.cs) have also been included to demonstrate the capabilities of the `ElementalForms` method.
